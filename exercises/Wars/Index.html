  <p class="newspaper"> Amazon Studios are the lucky lot tasked with recreating Tolkien’s magic for the small screen. In November 2017, they signed a reported $250m contract with the author’s estate to make a multi-series show for television. While the release did not include any mention of when the series will premiere or who is attached to star, produce, or direct, it did make a point of stating that “the television adaptation will explore new storylines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring” and that there was the definite possibility for spinoff series. Matt Galsor, a rep from the Tolkien estate also added that the series would bring to life a number of “previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s original writings.” Today in a press release, Amazon Studios’ head of scripted series Sharon Tal Yguado expressed the company’s excitement at the idea of bringing audiences with an Amazon Prime subscription back to Middle Earth.</p>
